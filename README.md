# Video Editing Scripts

I created these video editing scripts while working on the
[GT6000](https://grad.gatech.edu/gt6000) video project. These scripts were
mostly written to help batch clean up the audio. The scripts in here extract
the left and right audio channels, denoise the audio, and slow it down (for
some reason the audio and video recording speeds were a little off).
